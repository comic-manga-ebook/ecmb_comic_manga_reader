## About this repository
This is the mobile-app for reading the *.ecmb. It is free to use, without advertisement and without transmitting any data to a webserver.<br />
Unfortunately it is not open-sorce, coz I couldn't find a open-source-license which forbids commercial usage and for sure you don't want to see my really messy code.

## Searching for Designer

The app is finally finnished, but it looks horrible ([screenshot](https://github.com/comic-manga-ebook/ecmb_comic_manga_reader/blob/main/home_book_actions.png)), as programmers can't do designs.
So I'm searching for volunteer, who can do better colors and shapes for the elements. If you are interested you can contact me [here](https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/jobs/2024-11-03-a-better-design-for-the-mobile-app).<br />

Thank you very much!

## Why there is no IOS-App?

- to build and publish an IOS-App you need to have a Mac. I know - Virtual-Desktop, but this is forbidden by the license-agreement of macOS to use it on a non-Apple-Hardware and I don't have enough space on my C-drirve. 
- I'm European, and the way Apple treats other companies and Apple's behaviour regarding the DMA ([https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en](https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en)), the greediness and arrogance - NO, I won't support this company!
- Apple ist just the opposite of open-source
- this is a private project, I've developed for my personal use. As I don't have and will never have an IPad ...

<b>You can buy a cheap Android-Tablet on Amazon. Mine was 69â‚¬ on Black Friday! It is surprisingly good!</b>
... And of course: feel free to do your own app ;)
